===============================

This is a replica of the classic arcade game Frogger.
The purpose of the game is to get the player to the water without making contact with the enemy bugs. 
Use the up, down, right, left arrow keys to move the player by 1 box.
The player will be reset when it gets to the water or when it's caught by enemy.
Enjoy.
